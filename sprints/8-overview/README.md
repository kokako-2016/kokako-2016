# Sprint #8

> He ora te whakapiri<br>
> He mate te whakatariri<br>
> *There is strength in unity*<br>
> *Defeat in anger*<br>

## Wow.
Coding gives you the ability to express information in new ways. Data visualisation is a booming area, often driven by the [JavaScript library D3](http://d3js.org/). Here's a beautiful example exploring [Obama's 2013 budget](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/02/13/us/politics/2013-budget-proposal-graphic.html). Students have played with D3 during the bootcamp, and alumni in Dev Academy Consulting have used it to present data in this [report for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand](http://annualreport.rbnz.govt.nz/financial-highlights#key-points).

Number | Name | Rough estimated time (hrs)*
--------|-------------------|----------
1. | [Self care](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/tree/master/resources/self-care-ARTICLE/README.md) | 30 min
2. | [Writing short functions](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/tree/master/resources/js-writing-short-functions-ARTICLE/README.md) | 30 min
3. | Assignments | 19


## Assignments and resources
Find your assignments on your cohort's waffle board. **You must filter by your GitHub user name (see example below)** - find them at<br> `https://waffle.io/dev-academy-programme/`**cohortBird-year**`?assigned=`**yourGitHubUserName**
<br>
You will need to replace 'cohortBird-yearGraduating' and 'GitHubUserName', for example:<br> `https://waffle.io/dev-academy-programme/kakapo-2016?assigned=anahera`
In some cases, if you feel confident about the weekly concepts, you can skip straight to the assignments.

## Next steps
1. Read the concepts and their respective capabilities
2. Check out your assignments on the waffle board
3. Dive into the resources and develop your capabilities (linked from within the concepts)
4. Complete the assignments

## Handing in your work
- Check off all tasks within the assignments in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Move each of your assignments to the "Review" list in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Complete all tasks and have assignments ready for review by midnight Sunday
- Email your facilitator if you might be exceeding the assignment grace limit
