## Habits

<!-- learn > develop > practice -->
1. *Reflection* 
2. *Tidy*      
4. **Play**    


**Play** is the habit of staying curious and creative. To learn challenging concepts and solve the complex problems you'll face, you'll need to fully engage yourself, try new things and **not be afraid of failure**.
> Play is the highest form of research. — Albert Einstein

## Concepts
This sprint, you'll be learning some design skills to ensure you're building something useful with all your awesome new HTML and CSS skills.

## Assignments and resources
Find your assignments on your cohort's waffle board. **You must filter by your GitHub user name (see example below)** - find them at<br> `https://waffle.io/dev-academy-programme/`**cohortBird-year**`?assigned=`**yourGitHubUserName**
<br>
You will need to replace 'cohortBird-yearGraduating' and 'GitHubUserName', for example:<br> `https://waffle.io/dev-academy-programme/kakapo-2016?assigned=anahera`
In some cases, if you feel confident about the weekly concepts, you can skip straight to the assignments.
