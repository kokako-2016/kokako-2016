## Wow.
>what happens if you put a div in a div in a div in a div in a ..., each one increasing in size by 1px? - Eugene Lynch.

## Habits

<!-- learn > develop > practice -->
1. *Reflection*  
2. **Tidy**      

**Tidy** is the habit of keeping your code clean. If the project you are working on is successful, it is inevitable that you, or other people will work with it in the future. If you leave a mess, it is going to be very time and energy consuming to work with as it evolves in the future.

## Concepts
**NOTE: This is a big sprint and we expect it will overflow a little into next week. Be steady, timebox your assignments and know that next week, there will be less material and the chance to catch up.** 

This sprint's concepts are delivered through Udacity - an educational organisation offering massive open online courses (MOOCs).
Udacity offer an excellent introduction to using HTML, CSS and the DOM in their "not your typical Web Dev" course. The majority of the work for this week is in the course - unless you're already proficient, in which case you should work on the stretch material.

Number | Name | Rough estimated time (hrs)*
--------|-------------------|----------
1. | [HTML, CSS and the DOM](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/tree/master/concepts/html-css-dom-udacity) | 12
2. | [Git best practices](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/tree/master/concepts/git-best-practice) | 1
3. | [HTML and CSS best practices -*Technical debt* 1](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/tree/master/concepts/technical-debt-1) | 1
4. | [Emotional Intelligence](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/tree/master/concepts/nt-emotional-intelligence) | 1
5. | Assignments (see below) | 6

## Assignments and resources
Find your assignments on your cohort's waffle board. **You must filter by your GitHub user name (see example below)** - find them at<br> `https://waffle.io/dev-academy-programme/`**cohortBird-year**`?assigned=`**yourGithubUserName**
<br>
You will need to replace 'cohortBird-yearGraduating' and 'GithubUserName', for example:<br> `https://waffle.io/dev-academy-programme/kakapo-2016?assigned=anahera`
In some cases, if you feel confident about the weekly concepts, you can skip straight to the assignments.

## Next steps
1. Read the concepts and their respective capabilities
2. Check out your assignments on the waffle board
3. Dive into the resources and develop your capabilities (linked from within the concepts)
4. Complete the assignments

## Handing in your work
- Check off all tasks within the assignments in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Move each of your assignments to the "Submitted to EDA" list in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Complete all tasks and have assignments ready for review by midnight Sunday
- Email your facilitator if you might be exceeding the assignment grace limit.
