Web developers need excellent communication skills - for working together on problems, sharing difficulties, finding solutions, managing client and manager expectations, building systems that talk to each other, and writing readable code.  
Good communication leads to good relationships, less stress and better work. This course is an excellent chance for you to work on your communication skills - you'll need them at every step.

## Concepts

Number | Name | Rough estimated time (hrs)*
--------|-------------------|----------
1. | [Process over product](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/tree/master/concepts/process-over-product) | 15 mins
2. | Assignments (see below) | 15 hours


## Assignments and resources
Find your assignments on your cohort's waffle board. **You must filter by your GitHub user name (see example below)** - find them at<br> `https://waffle.io/dev-academy-programme/`**cohortBird-year**`?assigned=`**yourGitHubUserName**
<br>
You will need to replace 'cohortBird-yearGraduating' and 'GitHubUserName', for example:<br> `https://waffle.io/dev-academy-programme/kakapo-2016?assigned=anahera`
In some cases, if you feel confident about the weekly concepts, you can skip straight to the assignments.
