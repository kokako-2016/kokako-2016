## Wow.

Think about how you could build this - launching sound clips and appending divs and animations on key events... nothing too tricky...

## Concepts

Don't get too stuck on digesting all of the events resource before you've started the assignments! You'll be referring back to it again, and some of it will make more sense when you've had a chance to see the code in action.

Number | Name | Rough estimated time (hrs)*
--------|-------------------|----------
1. | [JavaScript events and CSS classes](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/blob/master/resources/js-events-and-css-classes-ARTICLE/README.md) | 1 hours
2. | Assignments (see below) | 19 hours

## Assignments and resources
Find your assignments on your cohort's waffle board. **You must filter by your GitHub user name (see example below)** - find them at<br> `https://waffle.io/**cohort-year**/`**cohort-year**`?assigned=`**yourGithubUserName**
<br>
You will need to replace 'cohort-year' and 'GitHubUserName', for example:<br> `https://waffle.io/kakapo-2016/kakapo-2016?assigned=anahera`
In some cases, if you feel confident about the weekly concepts, you can skip straight to the assignments.

## Next steps
1. Read the concepts and their respective capabilities
2. Check out your assignments on the waffle board
3. Dive into the resources and develop your capabilities (linked from within the concepts)
4. Complete the assignments

## Handing in your work
- Check off all tasks within the assignments in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Move each of your assignments to the "Review" list in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Complete all tasks and have assignments ready for review by midnight Sunday
- Email your facilitator if you might be exceeding the assignment grace limit
