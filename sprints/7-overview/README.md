2. | [Scope](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/tree/master/concepts/js-scope) | 15 mins
3. | Assignments (see below) | 15 hours


## Assignments and resources
Find your assignments on your cohort's waffle board. **You must filter by your GitHub user name (see example below)** - find them at<br> `https://waffle.io/dev-academy-programme/`**cohortBird-year**`?assigned=`**yourGitHubUserName**
<br>
You will need to replace 'cohortBird-yearGraduating' and 'GitHubUserName', for example:<br> `https://waffle.io/dev-academy-programme/kakapo-2016?assigned=anahera`
In some cases, if you feel confident about the weekly concepts, you can skip straight to the assignments.
