What did I do well this week?
- To start with I thought i was doing well will sprint 2... But (see below)

What could I have done to improve?
- Changing to MAC OS during phase zero = not as easy as i expected.
- github had an issue with my account, so i had to get Joseph to help me branch and clone my site to get it up and running again. As it seemed to be uploading to github, but not displaying the changes to the live site
- Need to get through the work faster
