What did I do well this week?

Caught up in lots of touch typing this week. If I can keep up the momentum on that I should be good for phase-1. Spent alot of hours on the minesweeper challenge as it was all territory I had not dealt with before. I understand an array, and an object and functions but never used them all at the same time and all within one another. I was unable to complete any of the stretch exercises without help but having found the solution broke it down, made notes, studied it and learnt from it.

What could I have done to improve?

Need to find time/ energy to do more reading, challenges and learning on top of EDA curriculum to ensure I am practicing concepts as much as possible.
