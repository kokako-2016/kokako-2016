Why is reflection important?

Reflection is important to aid the learning process. Often you can be too busy to stop and analyse your performance over a particular task or day. Without review there is no opportunity to plan for improvement. Reflection also helps you to appreciate just how good you are and how far you have come. 

 What did I do well this week?

This week I was through and patient with all the research and practical assignemnts. A couple of times I got stuck with CSS but I remained calm and worked through it and was stronger for doing so. I also ate heathly and slept well.

 What could I have done to improve?

Ironically I could have done a little more reflection and practiced a few more meditation sessions. I am a hands-on kind of guy and thinking about stuff aint really my style, I like gettin stuff done. This is something I am definately going to imporve on asap i.e. from today.
