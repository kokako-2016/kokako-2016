 What did I do well this week?

I put in a alot of time early in the week getting through all the reading and assignments. I feel I put too much time in on the writing of my blogs when I could have been using that time to imporve my technical skills. At the same time however, all learning and development is good. Just need to spend a bit more time building cool stuff and not writing long blogs people wont read.


 What could I have done to improve?

Missed a couple of days touch typing, mediation and excercise by being too eager to complete the weeks assignments, yet I have finished them with 2-3 days to spare. Need to start being firm on making sure I make time for these things on a daily basis and spread the workload out more evenly. #needMoreSelfControl
