What did I do well this week?

This week I feel I absorbed the JavaScript and jQuery stuff relatively well once exposed to it. I do however feel that they are both topics which can only be learned through repetition. Looking forward to more of the same and in more intensive blocks.

What could I have done to improve?

I had a busy weekend on the social calendar with close friends leaving Welly forever and a number of people I haven't seen for a long time down for Beervana. I hate losing the time and momentum when it gets to weekends and have now cleared my social calendar for next 2 weeks and throughout the entirety of EDA Phase 1.
