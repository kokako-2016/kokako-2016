What did I do well through my nine weeks in Phase 0?

Overall I am pretty proud of myself and what I have achieved leading up to, and during Phase 0. In total (including the time deciding to do Dev Academy) I have been working on this for approx. 16 weeks. I am happy with the level of commitment, focus and independent study I have maintained throughout this time.

What could I have done to improve through my nine weeks in Phase 0?

More reading about Web Dev related topics. I enjoy Codecademy, Treehouse, YouTube vids and practical exercises EDA have set but struggle to maintain focus and concentration when reading long articles/books. This is something that will only get easier and more enjoyable with practice and something I need to make more of an effort to force myself to do!
