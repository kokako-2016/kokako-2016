What did I do well this week?

Great work in terms of level of understanding. A penny seemed to drop with the calculator function, to just tackle one small problem at a time and the big solution will naturally follow.

 What could I have done to improve?

 Could always be spending even more time studying but feel a good balance in terms of self-care is important
