 What did I do well this week?

This week I managed to get through the JS assignments in good time. I also did a good amount of touch type practice resulting in be able to use more keys and increasing my overall speed.

 What could I have done to improve?

Could have done some additional JS exercises as only just hit over 20 hours but had a lot going on this week at home. Next week I would like to finish the sprint work and do an additional 10 hours plus on top. Need to increase my meditation time also.
