What did I do well this week?

This week was great. Found the wire-framing extremely enjoyable and picked Skeleton up relatively quickly. Still working through the website re-design as alot to get through and alot to consider. It will probably overflow into Monday at this rate but that doesn't worry me.

What could I have done to improve?

Probably could have time-boxed better but I am not restricted on time so it makes sense to keep learning and practicing as often as I can.
