 What did I do well this week?
 I caught up a little more, so that is good.

 What could I have done to improve?
 I’m definitely noticing that I’m not spending any time ‘prettifying’ my GitHub blog (unlike some other fellow cohort members). Instead, because I develop websites using tools such as Webflow, I’m kind of lazy in this regard. Plus, my time is extremely limited in the run-up to the immersion, so I focus on learning and studying rather than practicing my HTML/CSS.
