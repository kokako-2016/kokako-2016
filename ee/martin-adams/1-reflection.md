Why is reflection important?

Reflection is important to me because it offers wisdom—a chance to pause and learn from the events of the day. It also allows
me to calm my mind and thus allow greater clarity to emerge.

What I did well this week—toward the end of this week—is that I started giving myself each and every day to Phase-0, rather than
just trying to do it all over the course of several days.

I could have started this process sooner, though.
