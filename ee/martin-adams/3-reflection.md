What did I do well this week?
I caught up most of the overdue lessonsâ€”got a lot done.

What could I have done to improve?
I skipped some of the design lessons, partly because I already have experience in HTML/CSS design, and felt like it would be an
ineffective use of my time, given that other things in my life were taking precedence.
