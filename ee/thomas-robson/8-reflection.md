What did I do well this week?

My Mac died this Friday. I had already purchased a back up windows laptop. I spent Friday/Saturday trying to get it operational. I could have got stressed, but I handled it well. I now have my new machine up and running. On windows, big success.

What could I have done to improve?

I’m getting really tense and my jaw muscles often hurt. I’m zoning out quite a bit, I need to start on work earlier so that I spend more time on doing things to unwind.
