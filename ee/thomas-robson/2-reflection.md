What did I do well this week?
I ate well this week and I'm feeling better for it. 
When researching I'm beginning to find the information easier to retain.

What could I have done to improve?
This week I lot focus a number of times. I struggled with the blog posts. 
Perhaps I could spit them up, rather then leaving them all for last.
