What did I do well this week?
I managed to get on top of a few things. Sometimes When I'm dossing I've stated to think in code and type words out in my mind, seems like progress. Also I'm getting better at managing my workload.

What could I have done to improve? Still forgetting to practise certain things. I want to read a bit more foundational material on JS, just to try to instill them a little more effectively, I feel that I don't fully understand certain terms.
