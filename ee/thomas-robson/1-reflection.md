Why is reflection important?
In regards to empathy. I read an article about that published the results of a study. The study found those who read novels regularly, had a higher degree of empathy. I identified with this, as reading a novel forces you to identify with the key characters. But it also exposes the reader to a greater number of experiences they wouldn’t have had and this results in colouring their own perspective. Reading fiction by default is a solitary pursuit. So Whilst reading you can’t help but but reflect back what you’re reading onto one's self, this forces the reader to really think about herself/himself. Where’s this going? Well I have heard a say that “in order to know others, you first need to know yourself.’” Reflection how ever it is achieved is the start to knowing oneself and by proxy, others and ultimately growing as an individual. 

What did I do well this week?       
I’ve been unwell so I feel as if I haven’t done anything well haha. I guess I have learnt quite a lot and gotten through all the exercises. So I haven't done too badly.  

What could I have done to improve?
I could keep better working patterns, as I felt all over the place this week. I need to get back to the gym and to keep it light this week!
