What did I do well this week?
I focused more on the task that was at hand. I've also been able to do more mindfullness exercises this week.

What could I have done to improve?
I worked too slowly on the codecademy course and now find myself behind. I could concentrate on moving through a task, and less on my need to understand every factor
