What did I do well this week?
I managed to meditate and go for walks more often. I feel they are having a positive effect.
I also went through the course resources a number of times this week. 
What could I have done to improve?
I think that I need to start writing myself work plans. I found myself getting caught up on 
small things quite a bit st the beginning of the week.
