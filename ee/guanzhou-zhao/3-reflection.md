## What did I do well this week?

Step | Action
------------- | -------------------
1. | Read through concepts about **Website Design**, **wireframe**, **Responsive**, and **framework**.
2. | Redesign my blog website.
3. | Implement the design using **Skeleton** framework.
4. | Read **Search Inside Yourself** chapter 2.

## What could I have done to improve?
- If I could use my time more efficetively, I should have produced a better result.
- **Meditation** is very helpful to concentration. Will do it more frequently. Meditation gives me more meta-attention to pay on **Process Over Product**.
