What did I do well this week?
I worked full time in first 3 days of this week.

I read the concepts resouces briefly at first and jumped to assignment, then reading the concepts further more when I met the relative assignments.

I underestimated the assignments and spent too much time on reading Search Inside Yourself. So still working on assignments now.

What could I have done to improve?
I have been better than last week and been familar with the assignments and the organization of the curriculum.
Just, I need to be more efficient, as I am struggling to complete all the assignments in 4 days.
