## What did I do well this week?
- I bought the book of Search Inside Yourself from Amazon.uk, and the book is on it's way here now.
- I paid my old friend a visit today, Sunday, the last day of the week. It has been four weeks since we met last time.
- I've got the idea to build different styles of homepage, and I moved out the first step to create a new branch for it.
- I reflected all I have learned in the last 5 weeks, and reviewed all the resources I have.

## What could I have done to improve?
- Grab more time, and move quicker.
