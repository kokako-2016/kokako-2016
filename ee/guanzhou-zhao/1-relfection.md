 Why is reflection important?
 Human don't learn from experience, but trough the reflection of experience.

 What did I do well this week?
 I managed to complete all the tasks on time. I learned from resouces and I tought meditation to one of my friends.

 What could I have done to improve?
 Althought I was working fulltime from Monday to Wednesday, if I had started to wrok on assignments earlier, I could have completed assignments earlier and keep in same pace with my cohorts.

 If I had skimmed all the tasks at the beginning, I could have priorited the tasks and done them better.

 If I had had the skills of timebox, I could have done the reading resouces better.
