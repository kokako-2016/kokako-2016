This week I think I did well at soaring through the javascript coding assignments. I have had plenty of experience with java in the past, to the syntax and ordering of the language already made sense to me, but certain elements and phrases were new to me. I wanted to make sure I knew everything and didn't miss any details, so I did all the the codeAcademy tasks first. This was a good way to refresh my mind and there were a few new details I learnt. And then I worked through the entire Free Code Camp tasks in one sitting. I felt this was the best way to do it as once I stop I have trouble starting again, and my brain was completely engaged the entire time. 

I started the sprint 4 work in my 6th week at EDA, due to personal issues placing me behind. I am happy to have been able to complete an entire delayed week of work within 3 days, so hopefully by the end of this week I can have sprint 5 completed too. At this rate I should be caught up by the end of sprint 9 and ready to start boot camp.
