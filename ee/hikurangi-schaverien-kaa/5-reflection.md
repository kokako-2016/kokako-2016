What did I do well this week?

blasted through the work. the new material is hot stuff. balanced all of the work I had to do, EDA and otherwise really well. Got the routine happening.
nailed the meditation, it really brought up some deep and important stuff for me. feelsgoodman.jpg


What could I have done to improve?


add more to my repertoire, work more efficiently, improve my attitude and optimism/consistency.
