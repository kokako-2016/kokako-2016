Why is reflection important?

It's helpful to look back on what you did and assess what to continue doing and things that you didn't do so well. I think it will make your future learning more productive and time efficient.

What did I do well this week?

I talked to a few people in the cohort, seeking help and giving praise. I think it's important to start building relationships early.

What could I have done to improve?

Commiting more time to typing I think will really help me improve, I am not good at touch typing even though I type relatively fast with my own method but I have to ocassionally look at the keyboard which is a no-no!
I could of spent a bit more time on the waffles, I tried to crunch them all out pretty quickly since I'd done most of it before except using GitHub and Toggl. I have plenty of experience with Ubuntu as well so not much was new to me this week. I do love Git so far seems like a great medium to share work and it's fantastic to be able to do things offline then push them later.
