why is reflection important

Reflection helps us to see how well we are getting on with our learning or even how we are going on a project. It gives us time to look back on what we have acheived, what it took to acheive that, and how we could have done things better and/or quicker to acheive the same and/or better result

what did I do well this week?

I got my head around the command-line and Git user interface and commands. Managed to work through a team treehouse course I started a while ago, and used it to get a semi-ok looking page I think. Really like the tutorial once I got into it, really wish EDA still subscribed to treehouse for us, their tutorials seem to speak to me. haha.

what could I have done to improve?

Using the pomodoro technique more effectively, getting better at estimating how many sections to break each concept into.
