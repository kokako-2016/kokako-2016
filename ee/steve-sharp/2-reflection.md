What did I do well this week?

I spent alot more time on the work this week, getting deeper into the concepts rather than just rushing to get the assignments all done. Feel like I am starting to understand a little bit of what I am trying to acheive when I am writting code. Still need loads more work with CSS layouts, excited to try out things like Bootstrap and Foundation during the website re-design. Starting to write my blogs a bit like they are notes to help me later when I forget things. Seems like a good thing to me, even if nobody else is going to read them.

What could I have done to improve?

I enjoyed the search inside yourself chapter, but I am definately going to need to put in more effort with the meditation. Think I am just going to try read the book right through, so I can get an overview, and them come back and go through each video and the relavent chapter again each week.

Need to practice my typing more, got a better keyboard for my Surface Pro this week, so hopefully that will help. Mainly just need more motivation for it, I am struggling to get out of the style of typing I have developed. #tryhardersteve
