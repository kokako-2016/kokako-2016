Why Reflection is important:
Reflection is important because it helps you learn by analysing what you have achieved compared with what you wanted to achieve. It makes you think about yourself and your peers and how to get the best out of each other. 

What I did well this week:
I did well at chipping away this week - strarting my day early in the morning before work and keeping a list of the tasks required. I took lots of notes. Heaps of them! Now I'm going to read back through them. 

What I could have done to improve: 
I could have given myself more time to scan the concepts to obtain an even broader overview of the week ahead and pick out capabilities requiring attention. This meant I didn't get to the Time and Habits section in good time. Better scanning next time.
