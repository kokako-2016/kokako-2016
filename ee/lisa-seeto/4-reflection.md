What I did well this week?

I did the programming exercises very well, I think.  I got through all of them and was happy to finally see some code again :)

What could I have done to improve?

I feel like the general look and feel of my blog doesn't speak entirely to its purpose yet.  It's not terrible but it's not as good as I want it to be.  Next week, we'll be using JavaScript to improve our sites and I may look into fixing it up then.
