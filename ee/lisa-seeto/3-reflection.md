Phase 0 - Week 3 - Reflection

What did I do well this week?

This week I think I did well at perservering with a problem until I had found a solution or work-around that would suit my purposes.



What could I have done to improve?

I could've concentrated more on the process over the product.  I definitely felt myself getting frustrated at having not acheived things the way I wanted them to look/ function etc...
On a technical side, I definitely will think of mobile-first design in the future having seen first hand what happens when it's done in other ways- Such a headache to "fix".  I'll definitely be thinking about small -> large etc... I think that I should have also redesigned my site using updated wireframes (I did do this for one of the pages) as the photo's were terrible and the product didn't match the original intent in the wireframes.
