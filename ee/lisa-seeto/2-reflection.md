Phase 0 - Week 2

What did I do well this week?
I think that when I did start to work, I felt I maintained my focused and managed to get my work finished at a good rate.

What could I have done to improve?
In terms of the CSS challenges.  I think I could have taken more breaks during the task to help reset, and to research a little more about the best way to accomplish things so that I have a good idea of what to do before I do it, or so I know not to waste time on things that are at this stage too complex to achieve.
