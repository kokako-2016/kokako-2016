Why is reflection important?
Reflection is important for growth of self and helps to deepen understanding.  This week I read that we learn not solely from an experience but in reflection of that experience. Reflection is also good for self-regulation, mindfulness and developing a practice of gratitude.
This week, I think I was good at following the instructions on the assignments and picking up on things pretty well.
I thought I could be better with my own time management.  I also think that perhaps I should be a little more brief with some of our written communications/ assignments.
