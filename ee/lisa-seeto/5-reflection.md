What did I do well this week?
This week I think I did my programming exercises well.  I felt like I was getting through them all
quite quickly.  I like the blogs I wrote this week also.

What could I have done to improve?
I think that I would benefit from putting into practice more of the mindfulness techniques we've
been learning about lately.
