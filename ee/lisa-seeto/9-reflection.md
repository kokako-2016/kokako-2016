What did I do well through my nine weeks in Phase 0?

I think that I put in a lot of effort to the programming challenges.  I think
that I was good at seeking answers to solutions when I got stuck with a problem.


What could I have done to improve through my nine weeks in Phase 0?

I think I could have put more effort into the EE side of things in terms of
meditation and mindfulness.
