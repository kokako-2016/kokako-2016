What did I do well this week?
I enjoyed the algorithms from free code camp and all the programming tasks and I think I did
a good job with the quote generator despite not pairing or knowing what an API was.

What could I have done to improve?
I think that I started to become a tad discouraged when I started to dive into the JQuery/ API /XMLHttpRequest
stuff as I was reminded of how much there is that I don't know but that I want to learn.  I've
since seen it as something to be excited about and something to look forward to doing it in the future.  So
I think that I could do more to keep focused on the process over the product and to focus on learning.
