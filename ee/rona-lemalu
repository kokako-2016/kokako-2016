Why is reflection important?
It's good to acknowledge the things you have, and haven't done - Did I set and then achieve my goals ie minimum 20hours for the week on study..?

What did I do well this week?
I did more than 20hours and asked questions when I got really stuck.

What could I have done to improve?
Spent more time studying, less time going down rabbit holes ... it's just everything is so interesting!
