Hi there. I went through lot's of difficulties last week with the minesweeper. I find that
that I had problem to understand the logic and also I felt I was missing some bits
and was probably overcomplicating the problem. I went back through free-code-camp and watch
heaps of videos and write many lines. Hopefully things will get  better.
