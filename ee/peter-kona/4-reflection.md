Kia ora,
I found this week's challenges enjoyable like little puzzles. I like these kind of online courses. And I also like to think about how it works from the inside. I can improve my time tracking and also my focus to thinks that matters. Well another week behind us and another half of preparation to go.
Thanks for reading. Regards Peter.
